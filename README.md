# Telangana-Weather-Analysis-Power-BI-Dashboard 📊

Welcome to the **Telangana Weather Analysis Dashboard project repository!**
This project focuses on the visualization and in-depth analysis of historical weather data collected from various districts of Telangana, India. Built using Power BI, this interactive dashboard enables users to explore critical weather metrics that can support agricultural planning, environmental research, policy-making, and disaster preparedness.

## Objective

> **Analyze historical weather data** from multiple districts in Telangana to identify seasonal and geographical trends.

> **Build an interactive Power BI dashboard** that allows users to explore temperature, rainfall, and humidity metrics over different time periods and locations.

> **Provide actionable insights** through dynamic visualizations that support data-driven planning in sectors such as agriculture, infrastructure, and environmental policy.



## Tools Used
- 📊 Power BI – for data modeling, transformation, and interactive visualization
- 📁 Excel / CSV – for data input
- 🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for creating calculated measures and KPIs
- 🧹 Power Query – for data cleaning and transformation



## Project Learnings
Throughout this project, the following skills and experiences were gained:

- 📊 Building interactive dashboards to visualize and explore regional weather data.
- 🔄 Data transformation using Power Query Editor for cleaning and structuring raw weather data.
- 🔗 Establishing relationships between tables and performing joins for effective data modeling.
- 🧮 Creating custom calculations using DAX (e.g., average rainfall, temperature variation).
- 🧭 Using filters, slicers, and drill-throughs for user-driven insights at district and time level.
- 🌐 Designing map-based visualizations to analyze geographic weather distribution across Telangana.
- 🧠 Enhancing decision-making through data storytelling and interactive visuals.
